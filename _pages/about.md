I'm pursuing my PhD at UC San Diego, advised by <a href="http://misha.belkin-wang.org/">Misha Belkin</a>.
I am also a PhD Research Fellow at [The Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center](https://www.ericandwendyschmidtcenter.org/) of The Broad Institute where I was adivsed by <a href="https://www.gv.com/team/anthony-philippakis">Anthony Philippakis</a> (now a General Partner at GV).
For a full list of publications, see <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&authuser=1&hl=en&user=6ogHsLsAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&authuser=1">Google Scholar</a>.

My research focuses on understanding deep learning, both theoretically and practically. In the past, I studied: benign overfitting in neural networks and kernel regression; calibration in neural networks as it relates to generalization; spectral properties of the de Bruijn graph Laplacian; high-dimensional covariate shifts; and emergent phenomena in non-neural models through grokking modular arithmetic.

I am currently researching topics on fundamentals of feature learning, foundation model training and evaluation (through the lens of single-cell data), scaling laws and feature alignment, and multi-class learning in kernels and neural networks.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
