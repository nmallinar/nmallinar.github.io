I'm pursuing my PhD at UC San Diego, advised by <a href="http://misha.belkin-wang.org/">Misha Belkin</a>.

I am broadly interested in problems of representation learning, and understanding what it means to learn "good" representations.

In doing so I have been looking into the relationship between pre-training and continual / transfer learning in deep neural networks,
and specifically the role of over-parameterization and interpolation in these areas.

Additionally, I'm interested in studying how finite-width networks and their corresponding infinite-width limits behave in the aforementioned settings.
