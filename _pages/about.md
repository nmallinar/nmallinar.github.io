I'm pursuing my PhD at UC San Diego, advised by <a href="http://misha.belkin-wang.org/">Misha Belkin</a>.
I am also a Research Fellow at The Broad Institute where I am adivsed by <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/anthony-philippakis-0">Anthony Philippakis</a>.
For a full list of publications, see <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&authuser=1&hl=en&user=6ogHsLsAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&authuser=1">Google Scholar</a>.

My research focuses on understanding deep learning, both theoretically and practically. In the past, I studied: benign overfitting in neural networks and kernel regression; and calibration in neural networks as it relates to generalization. My current research focuses on spectral properties of De Bruijn graphs, high-dimensional linear regression under distribution shifts, and, most recently, studying phenomena such as grokking and in-context learning with transformers, fully connected networks, and kernels.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
